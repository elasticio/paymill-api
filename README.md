# Paymill API Description

This project contains a Swagger API for Paymill - the most innovative payment-as-a-service provider.
Before going into the description two words about **Swagger**:

## Swagger

From [Swagger Wordnik](http://swagger.wordnik.com/) site:

>Swagger is a specification and complete framework implementation for
>describing, producing, consuming, and visualizing RESTful web services.

We at elastic.io chosen Swagger as our first REST service description language, other languages
(e.g. *WSDL* for SOAP Services or *WADL* or *Mashape* description languages will follow).

Swagger have following advantages over other alternatives:

* It's open source project distributed under Apache License, Version 2.0
* It has a modular structure (core, code generator, UI, etc)
* It has a significant traction and community acceptance

We believe that even if you don't use Swagger right now for documentaiton of your REST API you might benifit
from it in the long-term e.g. from Swagger Code Generation.

## Contract

Goal of this desription is to provide an easy way to integrate Paymill API into elastic.io platform.
For that following should be stored in this Git repository: 
* It should have an *index* document called ```/api-docs.json```, typical Swagger structure that declares an entry point and references individual *resource* description files.
* It should have an icon called ```/logo.png```. This logo should be 64x64 pixels large and have a transparent background.

That's more or less it.
